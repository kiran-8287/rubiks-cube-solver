# Rubik's Cube Solver (React + Vite)

An interactive, browser-based Rubik's Cube solver. Paint the cube net with colors that match your physical cube, validate the configuration, and get an optimal move sequence generated by the Kociemba-based `cubejs` solver running in a Web Worker.

- **Live demo**: https://kiran-8287.github.io/rubiks-cube-solver/
- **Tech**: React 18, Vite, Web Workers, `cubejs`

## Features

- **Interactive cube net input** with a color palette
- **Validation** for complete/consistent cube states
- **Fast solving** via `cubejs` initialized in a Web Worker
- **Step-by-step solution view** with move count
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for power users
- **Dark/light theme** preference persisted to `localStorage`

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm

### Install

```bash
npm install
```

### Run (development)

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will start on a local Vite dev server. Open the printed URL in your browser.

### Build (production)

```bash
npm run build
```

### Preview production build

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Usage

1. Select a color from the palette.
2. Click the stickers on the cube net to paint all 54 stickers.
3. Press `Solve` to compute the move sequence.

If the cube is already solved, the app will let you know. If the input is invalid or incomplete, you will see a validation error.

### Keyboard shortcuts

- `w` → select `white`
- `y` → select `yellow`
- `r` → select `red`
- `o` → select `orange`
- `b` → select `blue`
- `g` → select `green`
- `c` → clear the cube
- `s` → validate and solve

## Project Structure

- `src/App.jsx` — main UI and interactions
- `src/hooks/useCubeSolver.js` — solver lifecycle and Web Worker messaging
- `public/cubeWorker.js` — Web Worker that loads `cubejs` and solves
- `src/utils/*` — validation and facelet conversion helpers
- `src/reducers/cubeReducer.js` — state management

## How it works

- The cube state is converted to a Kociemba facelet string using `U,R,F,D,L,B` order.
- A Web Worker (`public/cubeWorker.js`) loads `cubejs` from a CDN and initializes the solver once (`Cube.initSolver()`).
- On `SOLVE`, the worker constructs a `Cube` from the facelet string and calls `cube.solve()` to compute the move sequence, returning both the full solution string and parsed moves.

## Deployment

This project is configured to deploy to GitHub Pages. The Vite base path is set to `/rubiks-cube-solver/` when building.

Common flow:

```bash
# Build and prepare 404 for SPA routing
npm run predeploy

# Publish dist/ to gh-pages
npm run deploy
```

Ensure your repository has Pages enabled and points to the `gh-pages` branch created by the deploy step.

## Troubleshooting

- If you see “Solver not ready”, wait a few seconds for the Web Worker to finish initializing `cubejs` and try again.
- If solving fails, double-check that all 54 stickers are painted and each color appears exactly 9 times.
- If hosting under a subpath, verify the `base` option in `vite.config.js` matches your deployment path.
